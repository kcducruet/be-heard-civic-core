# Be Heard: Civic Deliberation Engine for the AI Era

**Be Heard** is an open-source platform for structured, AI-assisted civic deliberation.

This is a prototype civic immune system. It invites people to engage with complex questions, share perspectives, and see their input synthesized in real time by large language modelsâ€”transparently and respectfully.

Stay tuned for more as the project evolves.

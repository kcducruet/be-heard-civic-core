# Fair Hire: Legal Theory Brief

## Main Legal Pathways

### 1. Title VII Disparate Impact
- Challenge a facially neutral hiring system that disproportionately harms protected groups (race, gender, age, etc.)
- Does not require proof of intent

### 2. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
- Systems that penalize neurodivergent applicants, speech differences, or disability-related behavior may violate ADA protections

### 3. FTC Unfair/Deceptive Practice Claims
- Applicable if:
  - AI use is not clearly disclosed
  - Claims of fairness, neutrality, or explainability are misleading
  - Biometric data is collected without informed consent

### 4. State Biometric Privacy Statutes
- Example: Illinois BIPA (Biometric Information Privacy Act)
  - Requires consent for collecting face/voice data
  - Strong precedent for class actions

## Strategic Insight
> The problem is not the existence of the LLM. It’s how it’s prompted, scored, and deployed. The liability is in the logic built around the model—not the model itself.

# Fair Hire: AI Pattern Mapping Ideas

## Purpose
Use LLMs and clustering techniques to analyze incoming user data and identify systemic trends in algorithmic hiring outcomes.

## Analysis Ideas

### 1. Rejection Language Clustering
- Use natural language processing (NLP) to group similar rejection messages
- Flag vague phrases like:
  - "Not a culture fit"
  - "Low enthusiasm"
  - "Weâ€™ve moved forward with other candidates"
- Map frequency across platforms and roles

### 2. Platform Usage Mapping
- Track which AI tools are mentioned most (e.g., HireVue, Pymetrics, etc.)
- Correlate with patterns of reported harm or opacity

### 3. Demographic Disparity Analysis
- Optional demographic input can help track group-level differences in rejection rates
- Surface disparities tied to age, gender, race, disability, etc.

### 4. Resume Similarity Testing
- Compare similar resumes (from different candidates) and their outcomes
- Look for evidence of unexplained differential treatment

### 5. Employer or Role Tagging
- Tag companies or job titles that show unusual or concentrated rejection behaviors
- Identify potential systemic issues by employer or industry

## Tooling Notes
- LLM-based semantic clustering (e.g., OpenAI embeddings or open-source alternatives)
- Optional: Build a feedback loop where users can verify or refine cluster groupings

## Outcome
Generate public-facing insights, transparency reports, and support class action litigation by surfacing patterns no one person could see alone.

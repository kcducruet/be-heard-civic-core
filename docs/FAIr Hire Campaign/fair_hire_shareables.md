# Fair Hire: Public Awareness Toolkit

## Hashtag
`#FairHire`

## Social Media Captions & Slogans
- "I was filtered out by a bot. #FairHire"
- "Your next interviewer might be an algorithm. Know your rights."
- "Opaque algorithms. Disparate outcomes. We’re done being quiet."
- "AI should not be your rejection letter. Demand transparency."
- "We're not anti-AI—we're pro-accountability. #FairHire"

## Shareable Assets (To Develop)
- Carousel posts with:
  - Facts about algorithmic bias
  - What questions to ask HR
  - How to know if you’ve been screened by AI
- Infographic: How hiring algorithms work (and how they can fail you)
- “Know Your Rights” cards (ADA, Title VII, FTC basics)

## Templates
- **Letter to HR asking about AI use**
- **Email to elected officials requesting regulation**
- **Press talking points for campaign spokespersons**

## Distribution Strategy
- Partner with advocacy groups for amplification
- Use TikTok/Instagram Reels for awareness storytelling
- Encourage users to stitch/share their experiences using campaign hashtag

# Be Heard Problem-to-Solution Map

## Step 1: Surface the Problem
- Collect grounded public testimony  
- Let patterns emerge organically  
- Identify problems the system doesn’t yet recognize or measure

## Step 2: Categorize Solution Pathways

| Pathway                  | Description                                                            | This Campaign?         |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Policy**               | Legislative or regulatory intervention (e.g., FTC rules, EEOC guidelines) | 🔄 Possibly, but not soon in U.S. |
| **Concerted Civic Action** | Collective awareness + action to demand change (e.g., union pressure, public campaigns) | ✅ Yes |
| **Industry Self-Regulation** | Voluntary transparency or standards (e.g., model audits, explainability commitments) | ⚠️ Unlikely unless pressured |
| **Civic–Industry Partnerships** | Collaborations between orgs and platforms to fix shared problems | ✅ If framed constructively |
| **Public Good Startups** | Tools, APIs, dashboards, or platforms built to serve the people, not the profit | ✅ This *is* one |
| **Litigation**           | Class actions, legal advocacy, strategic test cases                     | ⚖️ Only if others run with it |

## Step 3: Branch the Response

- Be Heard continues to map the pattern  
- A partner or aligned group **forks the solution**  
- The solution (e.g., Fair Hire) becomes its own lightweight org, API, or tool  
- You support the **birth** of the solution—not the *lifetime parenting*

This model:
- Scales attention without diluting mission
- Keeps Be Heard nimble
- Honors your bandwidth and clarity

## Suggested GitHub Structure

```plaintext
/campaigns/FairHire/
  -> surfaced problem: algorithmic hiring bias
  -> proposed solution: public-good startup API for rejection pattern analysis
  -> current status: awaiting civic or legal partner to adopt + lead
```

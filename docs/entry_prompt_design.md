# Entry Prompt Design for Be Heard  
*Framing how people enter deliberative conversations with AI moderation*

## Why This Matters

In Be Heard, the way users are *invited in* matters as much as what they say once they arrive. This isn't just about capturing ideas—it's about setting the tone for thoughtful, self-aware discourse.

> We want to honor the cognitive labor already done, while creating low-friction starting points for new voices.

## Key Use Cases

- **Returning users with prior work (e.g., Substack, notes, past chats):**  
  Prompt:  
  _"Have you been thinking or writing about this already? Want to give your AI moderator some background on where you're coming from?"_  
  (_Upload a PDF, paste your notes, or summarize your current thinking._)

- **New users or spontaneous contributors:**  
  Prompt:  
  _"What’s bothering or exciting you about AI integration right now?"_  
  (_You don’t need to have done any prep. Start where you are._)

## Why We Don't Auto-Import Chat Logs

Chat logs are often enormous and messy. Instead of dumping tokens and context windows into overload, we prefer curated input. The user is prompted to *distill* what matters—creating better engagement and relevance.

## Design Philosophy

This system reflects our belief that AI should:
- **Meet people where they are**
- **Encourage reflective participation**
- **Avoid extractive assumptions about context**
- **Let humans choose what to share—on their terms**

## Future Considerations
- Tag-based onboarding flows based on user-provided “gist”
- Context layering based on emotional tone or intention
- Optional AI summarization of prior material (if user opts in)

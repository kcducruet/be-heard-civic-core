# Fair Hire: Exposing Algorithmic Discrimination in Hiring

## Overview
This Be Heard campaign investigates algorithmic discrimination in hiring platforms—especially those using biometric data, video analysis, LLM-driven scoring, or opaque automation. Our goal is to crowdsource real-world experiences, surface patterns of bias, and push for legal and policy accountability.

Millions of job seekers are being screened by AI-powered systems, often without transparency or recourse. Many never speak to a human. We believe the public deserves to understand what decisions are being made, by whom—or by what—and to demand fairness in employment systems.

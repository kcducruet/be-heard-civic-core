# AI Model Tiers: Selection Logic & Use Cases

## Why This Matters
New users won't know whether they need GPT-4 or GPT-3.5, and pushing everything to the most powerful model wastes compute and risks hallucination. We want model selection to feel invisible, but principled.


## Tier Overview
| Tier | Model | Use Case | Risks | Notes |
|------|-------|----------|-------|-------|
| Tier 1 | GPT-3.5 | Broad orientation, casual exploration | Hallucination risk, less nuance | Free, fast, good for curious entry points |
| Tier 2 | GPT-4 | Nuanced policy work, moderate analysis | Cost balance, still needs guardrails | Recommended for civic policy synthesis |
| Tier 3 | GPT-4o or Claude Opus | Complex reasoning, high-stakes flows | Expensive, requires containment | May need rate limits or approval |

## Mapping Entry Prompts to Tiers
[Examples like:]
- “I’m worried about AI in my kid’s school” → Tier 1, escalate if deeper
- “I’m proposing a legislative framework” → Start in Tier 2 or 3

## Open Questions
- Should users ever *choose* their model?
- Should the system escalate automatically based on complexity?
- What governance layer sits between prompt and model?

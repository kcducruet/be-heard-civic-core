# Trust Infrastructure for Collaboration in the Agentic Era
*A Be Heard Open Policy Thread*

## Problem
The U.S. leads in innovation partly because of its openness — but in the AI/agentic era, our collaboration landscape is "muddy":
- Researchers fear losing control of ideas when seeking funding or partners.
- Legacy IP tools (NDAs, patents) don’t map well to fast, multi-agent, cross-border collaborations.
- Without trust, early-stage partnerships collapse or move offshore.

## Why This Matters for U.S. Competitiveness
China, the EU, and Singapore are actively building secure, high-trust collaboration environments — making them more attractive to global talent.  
If the U.S. can’t offer predictable, fair protections, we risk brain drain and slower innovation cycles.

## Proposed Pillar in U.S. Innovation Strategy
> **Trust Infrastructure for Collaboration**  
> Make U.S.-based collaboration feel safer than anywhere else, without adding bureaucratic drag.

## Key Features
1. **Choice-of-Lane Framework** — Open, Shared Commons, or Proprietary, declared before collaboration begins.
2. **AI-Era Agreements** — Model-exclusion clauses, agent-run logging, and attribution guarantees built into NDAs.
3. **Evidence by Default** — Time-stamped hashes, contribution graphs, and sandboxed evaluation environments.
4. **Open Funding Safeguards** — Two-stage disclosure, evaluator firewalls, and transparency bonds for funders.
5. **Public Return Rider** — Small share of commercialized taxpayer-funded discoveries flows back into a national innovation fund.

## Benefits
- Increases willingness to collaborate across institutions and borders.
- Gives funders confidence that contributions are traceable and accountable.
- Positions the U.S. as the *global norm-setter* for fair, fast, collaborative innovation.
